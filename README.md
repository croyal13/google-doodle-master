# Google Doodle

## Brainstorm Ideas

* ELO (Electric Light Orchestra)
** Primarily Jeff Lynne of ELO

I want to make the Google Doodle in honor of one of my favorite classic rock groups, Electric Light Orchestra, mainly the leader of the group, Jeff Lynne. Some of my ideas for the Doodle is to have the "G" being in the shape of a Les Paul guitar (the guitar Lynne uses), the "OO" being Jeff Lynne's head (because of his afro-like hair) and the Jukebox spaceship shown on ELO's records, the "LE" will be like their logo except minus the "O" and moving the "E" to where the "O" usually rests. 

If possible I want to have the doodle play audio, such as when you open up Google and when the Google Doodle loads up, it plays an ELO song such as "Hold On Tight" or "Mr. Blue Sky".
